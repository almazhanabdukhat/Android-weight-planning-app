# android-weight-planning-app
This Java Android app calculates daily caloric need for weight loss, gain and maintenance within a period of time
defined by user (for ex. How many calories to eat to lose 3 kg in 1 month). 
The caloric need is based on user's gender, age, activity level, current weight, height, goal weight and desired time for weight loss/gain. Nutrition formulas such as BMR (Basic Metabolic Rate) were calculated based on Harris-Benedict Equation for women and men and later adjusted for the activity level of the user. Also, this app calculates Body Mass Index (takes into account BMI difference for Asians) and interprets the results. BMI interpretation relies on WHO BMI classification.
Harris-Benedict Equation for men:
BEE = 66 + (13.7 x weight in kg) + (5 x height in cm) - (6.8 x age in years)
Alternate Formula: BEE = 1.0 x (weight in kg) x 24
Harris-Benedict Equation for women:
BEE = 655 + (9.6 x weight in kg) + (1.8 x height in cm) - (4.7 x age in years)
Alternate Formula: BEE = 0.9 x (weight in kg) x 24
