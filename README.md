# android-weight-planning-app
This Java Android app calculates daily caloric need for weight loss, gain and maintenance within a period of time
defined by user (for ex. How many calories to eat to lose 3 kg in 1 month). The caloric need is based on user's gender, age,
activity level, current weight, height, goal weight and desired time for weight loss/gain.
Also, this app calculates Body Mass Index (takes into account BMI difference for Asians) and interprets the results.
