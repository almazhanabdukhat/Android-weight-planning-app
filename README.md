# android-weight-planning-app
This app calculates daily calories in order to lose, gain (for amount defined by user) or maintain weight for specific time
defined by user (for ex. How many calories to eat to lose 3 kg in 1 month). The caloric need is based on user's gender, age,
activity level, current weight, height, goal weight and desired time for weight loss/gain.
Also, this app calculates Body Mass Index (takes into account BMI chart difference for Asians).
